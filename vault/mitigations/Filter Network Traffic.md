## M1037

Employ network appliances and endpoint software to filter ingress, egress, and lateral network traffic. This includes protocol-based filtering, enforcing firewall rules, and blocking or restricting traffic based on predefined conditions to limit adversary movement and data exfiltration. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:<br><br>Ingress Traffic Filtering:<br><br>- Use Case: Configure network firewalls to allow traffic only from authorized IP addresses to public-facing servers.<br>- Implementation: Limit SSH (port 22) and RDP (port 3389) traffic to specific IP ranges.<br><br>Egress Traffic Filtering:<br><br>- Use Case: Use firewalls or endpoint security software to block unauthorized outbound traffic to prevent data exfiltration and command-and-control (C2) communications.<br>- Implementation: Block outbound traffic to known malicious IPs or regions where communication is unexpected.<br><br>Protocol-Based Filtering:<br><br>- Use Case: Restrict the use of specific protocols that are commonly abused by adversaries, such as SMB, RPC, or Telnet, based on business needs.<br>- Implementation: Disable SMBv1 on endpoints to prevent exploits like EternalBlue.<br><br>Network Segmentation:<br><br>- Use Case: Create network segments for critical systems and restrict communication between segments unless explicitly authorized.<br>- Implementation: Implement VLANs to isolate IoT devices or guest networks from core business systems.<br><br>Application Layer Filtering:<br><br>- Use Case: Use proxy servers or Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to inspect and block malicious HTTP/S traffic.<br>- Implementation: Configure a WAF to block SQL injection attempts or other web application exploitation techniques.

### Techniques Addressed by Mitigation
| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[Port Knocking\|T1205.001]] | Port Knocking | Mitigation of some variants of this technique could be achieved through the use of stateful firewalls, depending upon how it is implemented. |
| [[Adversary-in-the-Middle\|T1557]] | Adversary-in-the-Middle | Use network appliances and host-based security software to block network traffic that is not necessary within the environment, such as legacy protocols that may be leveraged for AiTM conditions. |
| [[Protocol Tunneling\|T1572]] | Protocol Tunneling | Consider filtering network traffic to untrusted or known bad domains and resources.  |
| [[Application Exhaustion Flood\|T1499.003]] | Application Exhaustion Flood | Leverage services provided by Content Delivery Networks (CDN) or providers specializing in DoS mitigations to filter traffic upstream from services.[^4]  Filter boundary traffic by blocking source addresses sourcing the attack, blocking ports that are being targeted, or blocking protocols being used for transport. |
| [[Exploit Public-Facing Application\|T1190]] | Exploit Public-Facing Application | Restrict outbound network traffic from public-facing servers to prevent unauthorized connections from initiating communications with attacker-controlled infrastructure. While this may not prevent the initial exploitation, it limits the attacker's ability to verify and control the compromised server post-exploit, reducing the overall impact of the attack. |
| [[DHCP Spoofing\|T1557.003]] | DHCP Spoofing | Consider filtering DHCP traffic on ports 67 and 68 to/from unknown or untrusted DHCP servers. Additionally, port security may also be enabled on layer switches. Furthermore, consider enabling DHCP snooping on layer 2 switches as it will prevent DHCP spoofing attacks and starvation attacks. Consider tracking available IP addresses through a script or a tool. <br><br>Additionally, block DHCPv6 traffic and incoming router advertisements, especially if IPv6 is not commonly used in the network.[^12]  |
| [[Reflection Amplification\|T1498.002]] | Reflection Amplification | When flood volumes exceed the capacity of the network connection being targeted, it is typically necessary to intercept the incoming traffic upstream to filter out the attack traffic from the legitimate traffic. Such defenses can be provided by the hosting Internet Service Provider (ISP) or by a 3rd party such as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or providers specializing in DoS mitigations.[^4] <br><br>Depending on flood volume, on-premises filtering may be possible by blocking source addresses sourcing the attack, blocking ports that are being targeted, or blocking protocols being used for transport.[^4] <br><br>As immediate response may require rapid engagement of 3rd parties, analyze the risk associated to critical resources being affected by Network DoS attacks and create a disaster recovery plan/business continuity plan to respond to incidents.[^4]  |
| [[System Binary Proxy Execution\|T1218]] | System Binary Proxy Execution | Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic. |

| [[Multi-hop Proxy\|T1090.003]] | Multi-hop Proxy | Traffic to known anonymity networks and C2 infrastructure can be blocked through the use of network allow and block lists. It should be noted that this kind of blocking may be circumvented by other techniques like [Domain Fronting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/004). |
| [[BITS Jobs\|T1197]] | BITS Jobs | Modify network and/or host firewall rules, as well as other network controls, to only allow legitimate BITS traffic. |

| [[Mail Protocols\|T1071.003]] | Mail Protocols | Limit the ability of servers and critical systems to initiate outbound email communications. Filtering SMTP/IMAP/POP3 traffic to only trusted mail servers reduces the risk of attackers using compromised systems to exfiltrate data via email or to receive commands from attacker-controlled email accounts. |
| [[VNC\|T1021.005]] | VNC | VNC defaults to TCP ports 5900 for the server, 5800 for browser access, and 5500 for a viewer in listening mode. Filtering or blocking these ports will inhibit VNC traffic utilizing default ports. |
| [[Network Denial of Service\|T1498]] | Network Denial of Service | When flood volumes exceed the capacity of the network connection being targeted, it is typically necessary to intercept the incoming traffic upstream to filter out the attack traffic from the legitimate traffic. Such defenses can be provided by the hosting Internet Service Provider (ISP) or by a 3rd party such as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or providers specializing in DoS mitigations.[^4] <br><br>Depending on flood volume, on-premises filtering may be possible by blocking source addresses sourcing the attack, blocking ports that are being targeted, or blocking protocols being used for transport.[^4] <br><br>As immediate response may require rapid engagement of 3rd parties, analyze the risk associated to critical resources being affected by Network DoS attacks and create a disaster recovery plan/business continuity plan to respond to incidents.[^4]  |
