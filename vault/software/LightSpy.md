## S1185

First observed in 2018, LightSpy is a modular malware family that initially targeted iOS devices in Southern Asia before expanding to Android and macOS platforms. It consists of a downloader, a main executable that manages network communications, and functionality-specific modules, typically implemented as `.dylib` files (iOS, macOS) or `.apk` files (Android). LightSpy can collect VoIP call recordings, SMS messages, and credential stores, which are then exfiltrated to a command and control (C2) server.[^1]  

### Techniques Used
| ID | Name | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[Process Discovery\|T1057]] | Process Discovery | If sent the command `16002`, [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) uses the `NSWorkspace runningApplications()` method to collect the process ID, path to the executable, bundle information, and the filename of the executable for all running applications.[^2]  |
| [[Execution Guardrails\|T1480]] | Execution Guardrails | On macOS, [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) checks the existence of a process identification number (PID) file, `/Users/Shared/irc.pid`, to verify if [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) is currently running.[^2]  |
| [[Keychain\|T1555.001]] | Keychain | [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) performs an in-memory keychain query via `SecItemCopyMatching()` then formats the retrieved data as a JSON blob for exfiltration.[^2]  |
| [[Ingress Tool Transfer\|T1105]] | Ingress Tool Transfer | On macOS, [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) downloads a `.json` file from the C2 server. The `.json` file contains metadata about the plugins to be downloaded, including their URL, name, version, and MD5 hash. [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) retrieves the plugins specified in the `.json` file, which are compiled `.dylib` files. These `.dylib` files provide task and platform specific functionality. [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) also imports open-source libraries to manage socket connections.[^2]  |
| [[Screen Capture\|T1113]] | Screen Capture | [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) uses Apple's built-in AVFoundation Framework library to access the user's camera and screen. It uses the `AVCaptureStillImage` to take a picture using the user's camera and the `AVCaptureScreen` to take a screenshot or record the user's screen for a specified period of time.[^2]  |
| [[Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\|T1041]] | Exfiltration Over C2 Channel | To exfiltrate data, [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) configures each module to send an obfuscated JSON blob to hardcoded URL endpoints or paths aligned to the module name.[^2]  |
| [[Web Protocols\|T1071.001]] | Web Protocols | [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185)'s C2 communication is performed over WebSockets using the open source library SocketRocket with functionality such as, heartbeat, receiving commands, and updating command status.[^2]  |
| [[Shared Modules\|T1129]] | Shared Modules | [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185)'s main executable and module `.dylib` binaries are loaded using a combination of `dlopen()` to load the library, `_objc_getClass()` to retrieve the class definition, and `_objec_msgSend()` to invoke/execute the specified method in the loaded class.[^2]  |
| [[Audio Capture\|T1123]] | Audio Capture | [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) uses Apple's built-in AVFoundation Framework library to capture and manage audio recordings then transform them to JSON blobs for exfiltration.[^2]  |
| [[Encrypted／Encoded File\|T1027.013]] | Encrypted／Encoded File | [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) encrypts the C2 configuration file using AES with a static key, while the module `.dylib` files use a rolling one-byte encoding for obfuscation.[^2]  |
| [[System Information Discovery\|T1082]] | System Information Discovery | [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185)'s second stage implant uses the `DeviceInformation` class to collect system information, including CPU usage, battery statistics, memory allocations, screen size, etc.[^2]  |
| [[File and Directory Discovery\|T1083]] | File and Directory Discovery | [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) uses the `NSFileManager` to move, create and delete files. [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) can also use the assembly `bt` instruction to determine a file's executable permissions.[^2]  |
| [[Browser Information Discovery\|T1217]] | Browser Information Discovery | To collect data on the host's Wi-Fi connection history, [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) reads the `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist` file. It also utilizes Apple's `CWWiFiClient` API to scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks and obtain data on the SSID, security type, and RSSI (signal strength) values.[^2]  |
| [[Binary Padding\|T1027.001]] | Binary Padding | [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185)'s configuration file is appended to the end of the binary. For example, the last `0x1d0` bytes of one sample is an AES encrypted configuration file with a static key of `3e2717e8b3873b29`.[^2]  |
| [[Software Discovery\|T1518]] | Software Discovery | If sent the command `16001`, [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) uses the `NSFileManger contentsOfDirectoryAtPath()` to enumerate the Applications folder to collect the bundle name, bundle identifier, and version information from each application's `info.plist` file. The results are then converted into a JSON blob for exfiltration.[^2]  |
| [[Network Service Discovery\|T1046]] | Network Service Discovery | To collect data on the host's Wi-Fi connection history, [LightSpy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1185) reads the `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist file`.It also utilizes Apple's CWWiFiClient API to scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks and obtain data on the SSID, security type, and RSSI (signal strength) values.[^2]  |
