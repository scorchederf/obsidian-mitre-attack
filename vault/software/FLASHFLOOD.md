## S0036

[FLASHFLOOD](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0036) is malware developed by [APT30](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0013) that allows propagation and exfiltration of data over removable devices. [APT30](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0013) may use this capability to exfiltrate data across air-gaps. [^1] 

### Techniques Used
| ID | Name | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[Data from Local System\|T1005]] | Data from Local System | [FLASHFLOOD](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0036) searches for interesting files (either a default or customized set of file extensions) on the local system.
