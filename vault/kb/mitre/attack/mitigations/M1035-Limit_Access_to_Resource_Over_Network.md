## Description

Restrict access to network resources, such as file shares, remote systems, and services, to only those users, accounts, or systems with a legitimate business requirement. This can include employing technologies like network concentrators, RDP gateways, and zero-trust network access (ZTNA) models, alongside hardening services and protocols. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:<br><br>Audit and Restrict Access:<br><br>- Regularly audit permissions for file shares, network services, and remote access tools.<br>- Remove unnecessary access and enforce least privilege principles for users and services.<br>- Use Active Directory and IAM tools to restrict access based on roles and attributes.<br><br>Deploy Secure Remote Access Solutions:<br><br>- Use RDP gateways, VPN concentrators, and ZTNA solutions to aggregate and secure remote access connections.<br>- Configure access controls to restrict connections based on time, device, and user identity.<br>- Enforce MFA for all remote access mechanisms.<br><br>Disable Unnecessary Services:<br><br>- Identify running services using tools like netstat (Windows/Linux) or Nmap.<br>- Disable unused services, such as Telnet, FTP, and legacy SMB, to reduce the attack surface.<br>- Use firewall rules to block traffic on unused ports and protocols.<br><br>Network Segmentation and Isolation:<br><br>- Use VLANs, firewalls, or micro-segmentation to isolate critical network resources from general access.<br>- Restrict communication between subnets to prevent lateral movement.<br><br>Monitor and Log Access:<br><br>- Monitor access attempts to file shares, RDP, and remote network resources using SIEM tools.<br>- Enable auditing and logging for successful and failed attempts to access restricted resources.<br><br>*Tools for Implementation*<br><br>File Share Management:<br><br>- Microsoft Active Directory Group Policies<br>- Samba (Linux/Unix file share management)<br>- AccessEnum (Windows access auditing tool)<br><br>Secure Remote Access:<br><br>- Microsoft Remote Desktop Gateway<br>- Apache Guacamole (open-source RDP/VNC gateway)<br>- Zero Trust solutions: Tailscale, Cloudflare Zero Trust<br><br>Service and Protocol Hardening:<br><br>- Nmap or Nessus for network service discovery<br>- Windows Group Policy Editor for disabling SMBv1, Telnet, and legacy protocols<br>- iptables or firewalld (Linux) for blocking unnecessary traffic<br><br>Network Segmentation:<br><br>- pfSense for open-source network isolation
