## Description

Adversaries may gain initial access to target systems by connecting to wireless networks. They may accomplish this by exploiting open Wi-Fi networks used by target devices or by accessing secured Wi-Fi networks — requiring [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1078-Valid_Accounts\|Valid Accounts]] — belonging to a target organization.[^2] [^1]  Establishing a connection to a Wi-Fi access point requires a certain level of proximity to both discover and maintain a stable network connection. <br><br>Adversaries may establish a wireless connection through various methods, such as by physically positioning themselves near a Wi-Fi network to conduct close access operations. To bypass the need for physical proximity, adversaries may attempt to remotely compromise nearby third-party systems that have both wired and wireless network connections available (i.e., dual-homed systems). These third-party compromised devices can then serve as a bridge to connect to a target’s Wi-Fi network.[^1] <br><br>Once an initial wireless connection is achieved, adversaries may leverage this access for follow-on activities in the victim network or further targeting of specific devices on the network. Adversaries may perform [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1040-Network_Sniffing\|Network Sniffing]] or [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1557-Adversary-in-the-Middle\|Adversary-in-the-Middle]] activities for [[kb/mitre/attack/tactics/TA0006-Credential_Access\|Credential Access]] or [[kb/mitre/attack/tactics/TA0007-Discovery\|Discovery]].




## Mitigations
| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[kb/mitre/attack/mitigations/M1030-Network_Segmentation\|M1030]] | Network Segmentation | Network segmentation can be used to isolate infrastructure components that do not require broad network access. Separate networking environments for Wi-Fi and Ethernet-wired networks, particularly where Ethernet-based networks allow for access to sensitive resources. |
| [[kb/mitre/attack/mitigations/M1032-Multi-factor_Authentication\|M1032]] | Multi-factor Authentication | Harden access requirements for Wi-Fi networks through using two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate, such as a username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator. |
| [[kb/mitre/attack/mitigations/M1041-Encrypt_Sensitive_Information\|M1041]] | Encrypt Sensitive Information | Ensure that all wired and/or wireless traffic is encrypted appropriately. Use best practices for authentication protocols, such as Kerberos, and ensure that web traffic that may contain credentials is protected by SSL/TLS. |
