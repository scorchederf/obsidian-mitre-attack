## Description

Adversaries may wipe or corrupt raw disk data on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. With direct write access to a disk, adversaries may attempt to overwrite portions of disk data. Adversaries may opt to wipe arbitrary portions of disk data and/or wipe disk structures like the master boot record (MBR). A complete wipe of all disk sectors may be attempted.<br><br>To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware used for wiping disks may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1078-Valid_Accounts\|Valid Accounts]], [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1003-OS_Credential_Dumping\|OS Credential Dumping]], and [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1021.002-SMB_Windows_Admin_Shares\|SMB/Windows Admin Shares]].[^1] <br><br>On network devices, adversaries may wipe configuration files and other data from the device using [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1059.008-Network_Device_CLI\|Network Device CLI]] commands such as `erase`.[^2]
