## Description

Adversaries may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network or cloud environment. Password policies are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1110-Brute_Force\|Brute Force]]. This information may help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).<br><br>Password policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems via various command shell utilities such as `net accounts (/domain)`, `Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy`, `chage -l <username>`, `cat /etc/pam.d/common-password`, and `pwpolicy getaccountpolicies` [^1]  [^5] . Adversaries may also leverage a [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1059.008-Network_Device_CLI\|Network Device CLI]] on network devices to discover password policy information (e.g. `show aaa`, `show aaa common-criteria policy all`).[^8] <br><br>Password policies can be discovered in cloud environments using available APIs such as `GetAccountPasswordPolicy` in AWS [^3] .


## Procedure Examples
| ID | Name | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[kb/mitre/attack/software/S0039-Net\|S0039]] | Net | The `net accounts` and `net accounts /domain` commands with [[kb/mitre/attack/software/S0039-Net\|Net]] can be used to obtain password policy information.[^7]  |
| [[kb/mitre/attack/software/S0378-PoshC2\|S0378]] | PoshC2 | [[kb/mitre/attack/software/S0378-PoshC2\|PoshC2]] can use `Get-PassPol` to enumerate the domain password policy.[^6]  |
| [[kb/mitre/attack/software/S0488-CrackMapExec\|S0488]] | CrackMapExec | [[kb/mitre/attack/software/S0488-CrackMapExec\|CrackMapExec]] can discover the password policies applied to the target system.[^4]  |




## Mitigations
| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[kb/mitre/attack/mitigations/M1027-Password_Policies\|M1027]] | Password Policies | Ensure only valid password filters are registered. Filter DLLs must be present in Windows installation directory (`C:\Windows\System32\` by default) of a domain controller and/or local computer with a corresponding entry in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages`.
