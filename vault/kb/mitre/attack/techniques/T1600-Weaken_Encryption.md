## Description

Adversaries may compromise a network device’s encryption capability in order to bypass encryption that would otherwise protect data communications.[^1] <br><br>Encryption can be used to protect transmitted network traffic to maintain its confidentiality (protect against unauthorized disclosure) and integrity (protect against unauthorized changes). Encryption ciphers are used to convert a plaintext message to ciphertext and can be computationally intensive to decipher without the associated decryption key. Typically, longer keys increase the cost of cryptanalysis, or decryption without the key.<br><br>Adversaries can compromise and manipulate devices that perform encryption of network traffic. For example, through behaviors such as [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1601-Modify_System_Image\|Modify System Image]], [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1600.001-Reduce_Key_Space\|Reduce Key Space]], and [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1600.002-Disable_Crypto_Hardware\|Disable Crypto Hardware]], an adversary can negatively effect and/or eliminate a device’s ability to securely encrypt network traffic. This poses a greater risk of unauthorized disclosure and may help facilitate data manipulation, Credential Access, or Collection efforts.[^2]
