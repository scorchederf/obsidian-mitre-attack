## Description

Adversaries may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment. Users may use valid credentials to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and RDP. When a user logs into a service, a session will be established that will allow them to maintain a continuous interaction with that service.<br><br>Adversaries may commandeer these sessions to carry out actions on remote systems. [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1563-Remote_Service_Session_Hijacking\|Remote Service Session Hijacking]] differs from use of [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1021-Remote_Services\|Remote Services]] because it hijacks an existing session rather than creating a new session using [[kb/mitre/attack/techniques/T1078-Valid_Accounts\|Valid Accounts]].[^1] [^2]
